# Security

## Container runtime

### User

The MQ server image is run using the "mqm" user.  On the Ubuntu-based image, this uses the UID and GID of 999.  On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux image, it uses the UID and GID of 888.

### Capabilities

The MQ Advanced image requires no Linux capabilities, so you can drop any capabilities which are added by default.  For example, in Docker you could do the following:

```sh
docker run \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --env LICENSE=accept \
  --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 \
  --detach \
  mqadvanced-server:9.1.1.0-x86_64-ubuntu-16.04
```

The MQ Advanced for Developers image does requires the "chown", "setuid", "setgid" and "audit_write" capabilities.  This is because it uses the "sudo" command to change passwords inside the container.  For example, in Docker, you could do the following:

```sh
docker run \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --cap-add=CHOWN \
  --cap-add=SETUID \
  --cap-add=SETGID \
  --cap-add=AUDIT_WRITE \
  --env LICENSE=accept \
  --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 \
  --detach \
  mqadvanced-server-dev:9.1.1.0-x86_64-ubuntu-16.04
```

### SELinux

The SELinux label "spc_t" (super-privileged container) is needed to run the MQ container on a host with SELinux enabled.  This is due to a current limitation in how MQ data is stored on volumes, which violates the usual policy applied when using the standard "container_t" label.
